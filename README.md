## Welcome!

Sip into Simplicity with Maui T-Quilla Sunrise! We've mixed the perfect blend to kick those Windows Credential Manager blues to the curbâ€”no salt or lime; just cmdKey required.
Maui T-Quilla Sunrise is your refreshing solution to T-SQL credential chaos. Forget fumbling through the Windows Credential Manager; we've bottled convenience in a sleek Windows app that's as smooth as a tropical breeze on a Maui day.

Speaking of Maui, it is built using Maui .net 8 and specifically targets the Windows PC audience.
This was built using Maui as a way to learn the framework. I had a lot of fun on this dream island.

## Usage

This app was built to manage T-sql credentials inside of your Windows Credential Manager.

It utilizes the cmdkey commands. Nothing special.

When you enter a username and password, the Entry for your server.domain.com:port and Update All Server Credentials button becomes available.
You may enter a new server at this time and it will be added to your Windows Credential Manager. 
It will also add to the Domains Picker below "Select Domain".

Pick the domains you wish to manage, or choose ###-ALL-### to update all of your servers.
A confirmation is given before it will update:
